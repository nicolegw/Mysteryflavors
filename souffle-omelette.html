							<p>I'm proud to say that over the past few years, I've mastered the art of the omelette. Having the right pan makes a difference so I always use the All-Clad, non-stick crêpe and omelette pan. The right kind of spatula helps too!</p><br>

							<p>But what first attracted me to this amazing, OMG omelette (from Half Baked Harvest), was the beautiful color combo of the eggs, spinach and blueberries. Then, my obvious curiosity around the flavors lead me to the kitchen to try it for myself.</p><br>

							<p>The first difference between this omelette and a traditional omelette is the cooking technique. The soufflé spin is a puffy, fluffy dream. If you've never made a soufflé, it's pretty simple. Once you've separated your egg yolks from their whites, it's just a matter of beating the whites and then carefully folding them in together.</p></span><br>

						<li>In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks, milk and a pinch of kosher salt and pepper until just combined.</li>
						<li>Using a hand mixer on high, beat the egg whites in a large bowl until they hold stiff peaks, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
						<li>Use a spatula to gently fold the egg whites into the yolk mixture, until just combined. If the mixture is not completely smooth, don't fret - just be sure to not deflate the whites.</li>
						<li>In your omelette pan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add and evenly distribute the egg mixture and cook without moving until the top of the egg just beings to set, roughly 4 minutes.</li>
						<li>Add the artichokes, spinach and Brie to one side of the omelet and cover skillet. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the cheese just begins to melt. Carefully fold over the empty side of the omelet to enclose and cook for 1 more minute. (If you're an omelette newbie, there are several videos on YouTube that walk you through this technique.)</li>
						<li>While your omelette cooks for one last minute, melt the 2 tablespoons of butter in a separate pan on medium-low heat. Once melted, add your honey, stirring to combine until melted.</li>
						<li>Generously drizzle honey butter over omelette and top with more spinach and blueberries.</li>
