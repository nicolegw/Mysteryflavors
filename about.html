			<h1>"Mystery Flavors has its humble beginnings. Just us, our little kitchen and our minds full of ideas."</h1>
			<p>
			Mystery Flavors celebrates the wonders of food. If you live in a country like Malaysia, you are surrounded by impeccable amounts of mouth-watering delicacies waiting to fill your stomach 24/7. Mystery Flavors started as a simple idea between two university students that recognised the dilemma of every university student: ‘What are we having for lunch?’. To fulfil and feed our desire to learn and share, we decided to document our little journey, experimenting new recipes and searching for new places to eat our hearts out. Every experience would be shared on our website, bringing you along with us as we explore the hundreds of thousands of restaurants, cafes and bars locally and all over the world.</p>

			<h1>Food Glorious Food!</h1>

			Our website, which had started as a small project as teenagers had now been a full-blown website for foodies all over the world. As we are still young, we can only afford to travel within the country in the search for Food Glorious Food. However, we aim to one day be able to forage the world to share our recipes and reviews with all our faithful readers.</p>
